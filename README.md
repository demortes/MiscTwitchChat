# Misc Twitch Api
## Description
This project is purely made out of the desire to aggregate a number of functions together and allow a chat bot easy access to items.

## Maintainers
The official maintainer is Kevin "Demortes" Dethlefs, a Senior Software Engineer, who provides his free time to do this. 

## License
All code here is maintained with the MIT License. This means users, developers or anyone in the world should not count on it to be maintained, unique or earth shattering. As with anything security based, assume all information gathered by the API is public domain. It is provided for free, and no data is exchanged with other companies unless required by law or to complete the action the user requested.

## Support
No support is given for the API. Questions on how to consume or use the API will be ignored. Repeated questions will result in further actions, such as blocking by the maintainer, or if particularly malicious/harmful, reports to appropriate authorities. If you would like to notify the maintainers of possible issues, file an issue ticket on GitHub and anyone interested can pick up and resolve the concern. If there are security concerns, you may email Demortes at [webmaster@demortes.com](mailto://webmaster@demortes.com).

## Contribute
Anyone is welcome to fork and modify the code on their own. If you'd like to see your code in the main API, feel free to fork, modify the code and test, then submit a pull request to the original repository. There is no gaurenteed time to approval. All code contributed to this project will be licensed under the MIT License. If you would like to contribute in other ways, you're welcome to spread information about the API to friends and family or tip me via [PayPal](https://paypal.me/kdethlefs).
